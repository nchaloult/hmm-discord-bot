# Corpus Files

Corpora live here as plaintext files. An example corpus file: `corpus.txt` has been provided. It
contains a written transcription of President Obama's 2016 State of the Union Address, found
[here](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union-19).

If you put multiple corpus files of your own in this directory, you can configure which one the bot
uses by changing the `FILENAME` env var in your `.env` file at the root dir of this project.
